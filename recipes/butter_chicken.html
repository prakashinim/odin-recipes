    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
      <h4>Step 1:</h4>
      <li>Make marinade: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl.
        Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon chili powder, and salt;
        stir to evenly coat chicken.
        Cover the dish and let marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.</li>

      <h4>Step 2:</h4>
      <li>Line a strainer with cheesecloth.
        Place yogurt in the strainer and allow it to drain for 15 to 20 minutes.
        Transfer drained yogurt to a medium bowl.
        Mix remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oil, garlic paste, ginger paste, melted butter, remaining 1 tablespoon
        chili powder, and garam masala into yogurt until well combined.
        Pour yogurt mixture over chicken, cover the dish, and refrigerate once more to marinate for 3 to 4 hours.</li>

      <h4>Step 3:</h4>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

      <h4>Step 4:</h4>
      <li>Place chicken on skewers; arrange in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

      <h4>Step 5:</h4>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until almost cooked through, about 20 minutes.</li>

      <h4>Step 6:</h4>
      <li>Make sauce: Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
        Stir in garam masala. When masala begins to crackle, mix in ginger paste, garlic, and green chile pepper.
        Sauté until tender, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in tomato purée, water, chili powder, and salt.
        Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring in honey and fenugreek.</li>

      <h4>Step 7:</h4>
      <li>Remove par-cooked chicken from skewers and place into sauce in the pan.
        Continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes.
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        Stir in cream until incorporated.</li>
