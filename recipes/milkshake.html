    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic and delightful beverage that combines the rich and creamy goodness of vanilla ice cream with the smooth
      texture of milk.
      The primary ingredients include vanilla ice cream, milk, and sugar, which are blended together until they form a
      thick and luscious drink.
      The vanilla flavor is typically derived from vanilla extract or vanilla bean, giving the milkshake a sweet and
      aromatic taste.
      Some recipes may also include whipped cream on top for an added indulgence, and a cherry or sprinkles for garnish.
