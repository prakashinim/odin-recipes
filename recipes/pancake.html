    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An old-fashioned pancake is a timeless breakfast classic, cherished for its simplicity and comforting flavors.
      These pancakes are typically made from basic ingredients such as flour, eggs, milk, baking powder, salt, and butter.
      The batter is mixed until smooth, with just the right balance of wet and dry ingredients to achieve a perfect consistency.

      Once the batter is prepared, it's poured onto a hot griddle or skillet greased with butter or oil.
      The pancakes cook until golden brown on each side, developing a slightly crispy exterior while remaining fluffy and tender on the inside.
      The aroma of buttery pancakes fills the air as they cook, creating an inviting atmosphere in the kitchen.

      Old-fashioned pancakes can be enjoyed in various ways, from traditional toppings like maple syrup and butter to more creative additions such as fresh fruits, whipped cream, chocolate chips, or nuts.
      Their versatility makes them suitable for any occasion, whether it's a leisurely weekend brunch or a quick and satisfying weekday breakfast.
      With their nostalgic charm and delicious taste, old-fashioned pancakes continue to be a beloved morning staple for many.
